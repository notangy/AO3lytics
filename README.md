Special mention to [ao3-stats-exporter](https://github.com/Mircoxi/ao3-stats-exporter) for laying the groundwork for this project!

A lightweight command line tool and web dashboard for those who use archiveofourown.org (aka AO3).

- Run the script on a schedule to gather consistent metrics from your own statistics, or just adhoc!
- Keep an offline record of your bookmarks: when a work you saved years ago ends up deleted, no more wondering what it was about ðŸ¤”
- See graphs of your own statistics: fandom breakdowns by year, word count growth, etc

# Does this scrape data from AO3?

It is not a 'data scraper' in the sense that it mass-downloads hundreds of pages at a time. The only data pulled is your own user data, which remains completely inaccesible to anyone other than yourself and whoever you choose to share it with. It also saves data relating to your bookmarks and 'marked for later' queues. Other than that, every effort is made to reduce load on AO3's servers by only fetching new data once and then saving it locally for querying.

# How do I run it?
